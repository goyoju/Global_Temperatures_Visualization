# Global Temperatures by Country

This project aims to visualize global temperatures by country. This will create a powerful tool to illustrate the realities of global warming. As a major challenge facing humanity, effectively depicting the impact of rising temperatures across different countries can raise awareness of the significant threat global warming poses.
Also the updated version automatically displays visualizations of global temperature data, cycling through each year's data every one second. This feature allows users to observe the historical trends of temperature changes across different countries and track the overall change in average temperature over time.

## Final Version:



## Previous Versions:
**First Version:**

**Weakness:** The current visualization presents too much information at once, making it difficult for users to focus on specific details such as the year or individual countries. 

**Solution:** To address this, we can create a horizontal bar chart displaying only the top 10 countries with the highest average temperatures. Additionally, since there isn't a significant amount of data before the 1900s, it's preferable to display data from that time onward. We should also adjust the year labels to improve the clarity of the visualization.
