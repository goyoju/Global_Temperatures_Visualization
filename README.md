# Global Temperatures by Country
## By Junyoung Seo
This project aims to visualize global temperatures by country. This will create a powerful tool to illustrate the realities of global warming. As a major challenge facing humanity, effectively depicting the impact of rising temperatures across different countries can raise awareness of the significant threat global warming poses.
Also the updated version automatically displays visualizations of global temperature data, cycling through each year's data every one second. This feature allows users to observe the historical trends of temperature changes across different countries and track the overall change in average temperature over time.
